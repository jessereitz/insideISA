# InsideISA-Revamp

This project is the first step to the InsideISA-revamp email generator and the ISA Easy Email generator. This project was created to allow my colleagues and I to create consistently styled and formatted HTML Emails. The in-house HTML email tool at my former company didn't allow for the easy sharing or reuse of templates so I figured I'd make a solution myself. 

This particular project provides a simple form for users to input the information they would like to be included in the email. They can then preview the email and/or copy the code for use in the in-house HTML email editor.
